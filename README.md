The Application Gateway Ingress Controller allows the [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-gateway/) to be used as the ingress for an [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) aka AKS cluster. As shown in the figure below, the ingress controller runs as a pod within the AKS cluster. It consumes [Kubernetes Ingress Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) and converts them to an Azure Application Gateway configuration which allows the gateway to load-balance traffic to Kubernetes pods.

This module helps in deploying the necessary resources for the greenfield deployment of necessary resources for AKS cluster with Application Gateway as ingress controller.

## Setup
* **Greenfield Deployment**: If you are starting from scratch, refer to these [installation](docs/install-new.md) instructions which outlines steps to deploy an AKS cluster with Application Gateway and install application gateway ingress controller on the AKS cluster.

## Usage
Refer to the [tutorials](https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md) to understand how you can expose an AKS service over HTTP or HTTPS, to the internet, using an Azure Application Gateway.

## Usage of the module
```hcl


resource "azurerm_resource_group" "test" {
  name     = "testResourceGroup1"
  location = "West US"

  tags {
    environment = "dev"
    costcenter  = "it"
  }
}


module "appgw-ingress-k8s-cluster" {
  source                              = "Azure/appgw-ingress-k8s-cluster/azurerm"
  version                             = "0.1.0"
  resource_group_name                 = azurerm_resource_group.test.name
  location                            = "westus"
  aks_service_principal_app_id        = "<App ID of the service principal>"
  aks_service_principal_client_secret = "<Client secret of the service principal>"
  aks_service_principal_object_id     = "<Object ID of the service principal>"

  tags = {
    environment = "dev"
    costcenter  = "it"
  }
}

```
